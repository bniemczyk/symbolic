symbolic mathematics for python

SymPy is much more complete, but for my use it was to heavyweight and buggy.  Use
this if you only need basic symbolics in python.  If you want more, use SymPy.

The z3 directory in the source is a git submodule of Microsofts Z3 solver, which I am adding support
to use.
